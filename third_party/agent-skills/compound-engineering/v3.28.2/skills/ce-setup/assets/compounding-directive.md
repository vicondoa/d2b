# Compounding directive

Standing-instruction text `ce-setup` offers to add to a project's agent-instructions file. Insert one variant verbatim; the wording is pinned to the `ce-compound` guide by a test.

## Offer first

After a solved, verified problem, offer once to invoke the `ce-compound` skill at the completion checkpoint only when the work produced durable project reasoning that is not readily recoverable from the final code, tests, types, comments, or existing documentation, and losing it would plausibly cause recurrence, material risk, or substantial rediscovery. Apply this counterfactual: if the learning document disappeared, would a future engineer reading the final implementation still be likely to repeat the mistake or redo substantial investigation? If not, do not offer. Completion, effort, and diff size alone are not enough. Offer at the checkpoint so a qualifying learning can ship in the PR that produced it, and only where the repository treats captured learnings as tracked, committed knowledge.

## Run automatically

After a solved, verified problem, automatically invoke the `ce-compound` skill with `mode:non-interactive` at the completion checkpoint only when the work produced durable project reasoning that is not readily recoverable from the final code, tests, types, comments, or existing documentation, and losing it would plausibly cause recurrence, material risk, or substantial rediscovery. Apply this counterfactual: if the learning document disappeared, would a future engineer reading the final implementation still be likely to repeat the mistake or redo substantial investigation? If not, do not invoke it. Completion, effort, and diff size alone are not enough. Capture at the checkpoint so a qualifying learning can ship in the PR that produced it, and only where the repository treats captured learnings as tracked, committed knowledge.
