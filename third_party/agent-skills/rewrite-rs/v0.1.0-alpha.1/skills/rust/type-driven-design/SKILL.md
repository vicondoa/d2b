description: Make illegal states unrepresentable — enums instead of boolean and string flags, newtypes instead of bare primitives, parsed types instead of validated ones, typestate for protocol order. Use when a struct has fields that are only valid in some combinations, when validation is re-checked at many call sites, when boolean flags multiply, or when the user asks how to model a domain in Rust.

# Type-Driven Design

A type is a promise about which states exist. This skill changes *what the types
allow* — it is the only skill in the Rust bucket that restructures a domain
model, and it does so with a stopping rule: encode an invariant in a type when
violating it is a real bug class in this codebase, not when it is merely
expressible. How a rejection is reported is `/rust-errors`; what a change to a
published type costs is `/rust-api-design`.

## The principle

A type that cannot represent the bad state removes the runtime check, the test
for it, and the bug report about it. Ask of every struct: how many field
combinations are constructible, and how many are valid? The gap between those two
numbers is the surface where bugs live.

## Enums over flag soup

Two booleans make four states; if only three are valid, the fourth is a latent
bug:

```rust,ignore
// Four states, three valid: is_draft && is_published is nonsense.
struct Post {
    is_draft: bool,
    is_published: bool,
    published_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}

// Three states, three valid, and published_at cannot go missing.
enum Post {
    Draft { body: String },
    Scheduled { body: String, at: DateTime<Utc> },
    Published { body: String, at: DateTime<Utc> },
}
```

The same move covers the `Option<T>` pair smell: two `Option` fields where
exactly one is always `Some` is an enum with two variants, and the impossible
combination — both `None` — stops being constructible.

## Parse, do not validate

A function that takes `&str` and checks it is a valid email address checks again
at the next call site, and the next, because the type carries no proof. A
function that takes `Email` — constructible only through
`Email::parse(&str) -> Result<Email, EmailError>` — checks once at the boundary
and never again. The type is the proof the check ran.

```rust,ignore
struct Email(String); // private field: the constructor is the only way in

impl Email {
    fn parse(input: &str) -> Result<Self, EmailError> {
        // the check, exactly once
    }
}

fn deliver(to: &Email) { /* no validation possible here — none needed */ }
```

The private field is the load-bearing part. A public field makes the
constructor a suggestion, and the invariant dies the day someone builds the
struct by literal.

## Newtypes as invariant carriers

`/idiomatic-rust` reaches for a newtype to stop two arguments of the same
primitive being swapped at a call site. Here the newtype *carries an invariant*:
`NonEmptyVec<T>`, `Percentage`, `Sanitized<String>` — types whose constructor is
the only entrance and whose fields are private. The standard library already
runs this pattern: `NonZeroU32` and friends, with the niche-optimization payoff
that `Option<NonZeroU32>` is the same size as `u32`.
The same argument applies to numbers, where the type system will otherwise let
a byte count be added to a millisecond count — `NonZero` for what cannot be
zero, `TryFrom` rather than `as` at every boundary, and `NUMERICS.md` for the
rest.

## Typestate for protocol order

When operations must happen in sequence — connect before send, build before
finalize — the stage can be encoded in a type parameter, so calling out of order
is a compile error rather than a runtime `Err`. The full worked example, the
builder variant, and the costs live in `TYPESTATE.md`; the one-line version is
that typestate is for small, fixed state machines where out-of-order use is a
real bug class.

## When to stop

Type-level modelling has a cost: worse error messages, heavier generics, and a
refactor tax when the domain changes. A five-parameter typestate builder for a
struct built once in `main` is over-engineering, and this skill says so rather
than leaving the call to a reviewer.

## Deferrals

How the constructor reports rejection is `/rust-errors`. Whether the resulting
type is ergonomic for callers, and whether tightening a type is a semver break,
is `/rust-api-design`. If the model change is being forced by borrow-checker
pain, run `/ownership-not-clone` first — the answer may be ownership, not
modelling.

## Verification

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets   # add -- -D warnings only if the repo has no lint config
cargo test
```

Run clippy at the lint level configured in the repo — never on top of one the
repo already set. Then the specific evidence this skill claims: after the
change, the runtime checks the type made impossible should be *deleted*, not
left in place. Grep for the now-impossible branch and confirm it is gone, and
confirm the tests that asserted the old runtime rejection were removed or
rewritten to a compile-fail expectation. If the repo already uses `trybuild`,
add a compile-fail case proving the illegal construction no longer compiles; if
it does not, do not introduce the dependency as part of this change — state the
compile-fail expectation in a doc comment instead.
