# Wave validation evidence schema

Canonical reference for the host-local proof files that gate
`d2b.defaultSwitchReadiness.<wave>.validated = true`. (These files
no longer drive `d2b.daemonExperimental.enable`, which now defaults
`true` and is no longer evidence-auto-flipped but still functionally
gates the daemon control plane; they remain live for the per-wave
`validated` assertion and for `d2b host validate`.)

The schema is implicitly defined by the cargo-checked validator in
[`nixos-modules/options-daemon.nix`](../../nixos-modules/options-daemon.nix)
(`validationEvidencePresent`). This document is the operator-facing
mirror of that validator; the two MUST be kept in sync. The
companion JSON Schema lives at
[`wave-evidence-schema.json`](./wave-evidence-schema.json).

## File location

```
/var/lib/d2b/validated/<wave>.json
```

One file per wave. The basename (sans `.json`) MUST match the
`wave` field inside the payload, and MUST be one of the keys
declared in
[`nixos-modules/options-daemon.nix`](../../nixos-modules/options-daemon.nix)
under `readinessWaveSpecs` (see the [per-wave inventory](#per-wave-inventory)
below).

Recommended permissions: `0644 root:root`. The file is read at
eval time by Nix (under the building user), so it must be
world-readable; it carries no secrets.

## Schema

Every payload is a JSON object with three required string fields.
Additional fields are tolerated (and preserved by future
operator-verb writers for forward-compat).

| Field               | Type     | Required | Validator predicate                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wave`              | `string` | yes      | `builtins.isString payload.wave && payload.wave == <basename>`                      |
| `timestamp`         | `string` | yes      | `builtins.isString payload.timestamp && payload.timestamp != ""`                    |
| `operatorSignature` | `string` | yes      | `builtins.isString payload.operatorSignature && payload.operatorSignature != ""`    |

Failure of any predicate flips the per-wave assertion shipped from
`options-daemon.nix`:

```
d2b.defaultSwitchReadiness.<wave>.validated = true requires
/var/lib/d2b/validated/<wave>.json to exist and contain JSON
fields "wave" = "<wave>", "timestamp", and "operatorSignature".
```

### Canonical example

```json
{
  "wave": "p0",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-12T17:42:11Z",
  "operatorSignature": "alice@example"
}
```

### Field semantics

- **`wave`** — wave identifier. Must equal the file basename so a
  copied-by-mistake `p0.json` cannot satisfy `p1`.
- **`timestamp`** — when the validating smoke run completed.
  RFC 3339 / ISO-8601 UTC is the recommended shape; the
  validator enforces only non-empty `string`.
- **`operatorSignature`** — who attests to the run. Free-form
  string; typical shapes are `alice@example`,
  `ci-bot@build-host-3`, or a host fingerprint. The validator
  enforces only non-empty `string`.

Additional fields (e.g. `bundleHash`, `smokeScript`, `auditLogRefs`)
are permitted and intended for richer P5/P6 writers; the eval-time
validator ignores them.

## Per-wave inventory

Every readiness wave declared in `readinessWaveSpecs` requires an
evidence file under `/var/lib/d2b/validated/<wave>.json` before
`d2b.defaultSwitchReadiness.<wave>.validated = true` will pass
eval.

Cross-dependencies enforced by additional assertions in
`options-daemon.nix`:

- `w5Fu.implemented = true` requires `w4Fu.implemented = true`
  (GPU/audio sidecars spawn through the W4-fu `SpawnRunner` broker
  exec).
- `w5Fu.validated = true` requires `w4Fu.validated = true`
  (W5-fu validation depends on the W4-fu `SpawnRunner` path already
  being validated).

## Operator workflow

The intended path from a fresh host to a wave's
`defaultSwitchReadiness.<wave>.validated = true`:

1. **Land the code.** `nixos-rebuild switch` to a d2b version
   that ships the wave's implementation (`implemented = true`
   already defaults on for the `w*Fu` waves; `p0..p7` flip in their
   own merge commits).

2. **Exercise the wave on this host.** Run the per-wave smoke
   listed in the inventory above. For `w5Fu` / `w6Fu` this is
   `tests/host-integration/hardware/hardware-smoke-gpu-yubikey.sh`; for `p0` it is
   `tests/d2bd-startup-smoke.sh`; etc.

3. **Write the evidence file.** Run:

   ```bash
   sudo d2b host validate --apply
   ```

   (P5 sibling deliverable; see [`host-validate.md`](./host-validate.md).)
   The verb composes the per-wave evidence record from the
   wave inventory and writes one
   `/var/lib/d2b/validated/<wave>.json` file per wave with
   the canonical `{wave, timestamp, operatorSignature}` payload.
   It does NOT itself run the validators — operators are expected
   to have run each wave's validator (`tests/minijail-validator-*.sh`,
   etc.) by hand or in a CI job, OR to rely on the daemon's
   opportunistic evidence-write path described below. `--dry-run`
   (the default) prints the same set of payloads without writing
   them; `--wave <wave>` narrows the run to a single wave.

   The daemon also opportunistically writes evidence on its
   first successful op for the corresponding wave (e.g. the first
   end-to-end `d2b vm start --apply` writes `p4.json`),
   bootstrapping operators who do not run `host validate`
   explicitly.

4. **Flip the readiness bit.** Add to host config:

   ```nix
   d2b.defaultSwitchReadiness.<wave>.validated = true;
   ```

5. **Rebuild.** `nixos-rebuild switch` now sees
   `defaultSwitchReadiness.<wave>.validated = true` for each
   wave whose evidence file is present, and the fail-closed eval
   assertion passes. The wave evidence no longer computes or flips
   the `d2b.daemonExperimental.enable` default: that option
   defaults `true` and still functionally gates the daemon control
   plane, independent of these `validated` bits.

`d2b.daemonExperimental.enable` still functionally gates the
daemon control plane: it defaults `true`, and consumers should leave
it at its default (setting it `false` reverts the host to the
unsupported pre-daemon legacy state). What changed is that the wave
evidence no longer computes or flips that default. The `validated`
bits remain meaningful as host-local validation evidence, surfaced by
`d2b host validate`.

### Manual evidence writing (escape hatch)

`d2b host validate` is the supported writer. If it is
unavailable (e.g. an older daemon, a partial bootstrap, or a CI
fixture), the same file can be hand-rolled:

```bash
sudo install -d -o root -g root -m 0755 /var/lib/d2b/validated
sudo tee /var/lib/d2b/validated/p0.json > /dev/null <<'JSON'
{
  "wave": "p0",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-12T17:42:11Z",
  "operatorSignature": "alice@example"
}
JSON
sudo chmod 0644 /var/lib/d2b/validated/p0.json
```

The eval-time validator does not care who wrote the file, only
that the three fields are present and well-typed.
