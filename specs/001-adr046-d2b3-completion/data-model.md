# Phase 1 Data Model: Complete the ADR-046 Provider Control Plane (d2b 3.0)

**Feature**: `001-adr046-d2b3-completion` | **Date**: 2026-07-29

This document summarizes the resource object model the program must make live. It is a
**navigational summary, not a redefinition**. The normative source for every field, rule, and
state machine is the ADR-046 specification set; each section cites its owning spec. Where this
document and a spec disagree, the spec wins.

**Completeness**: this file deliberately does not enumerate every field of every type - that
lives in the specs and in the generated `docs/reference/schemas/v3/` bytes. For the coverage
proof that every one of the 55 specs and 545 work items is accounted for, and for the binding
rule that `detailedDesign` and `validation` text is carried verbatim rather than paraphrased,
see [spec-coverage.md](./spec-coverage.md).

## 1. Containment model

```text
Zone  (isolation, policy, routing, resource ownership, state, audit)
 |
 +-- exactly one embedded resource store (redb)
 +-- exactly one resource service (d2b.resource.v3)
 +-- exactly one authoritative Zone/<zone-name> self resource
 +-- exactly one fixed core-controller process
 +-- Zone-local Providers, Hosts, Guests, controllers, policies, and ordinary resources
 |
 +-- ZoneLink/<name>  ---> a child Zone, accessed only through the child's Zone API
```

Invariants that acceptance tests must hold:

- Every resource belongs to **exactly one** Zone.
- `Zone.spec` is **empty**. Zone-wide ceilings and emergency controls are separate `Quota` and
  `EmergencyPolicy` resources with their own controllers and status.
- Ordinary resource references **never** cross Zones. A parent reaches a child only through a
  local `ZoneLink` and the child's own API (FR-009, SC-008).

Owning specs: `ADR-046-resource-object-model`, `ADR-046-resources-zone-control`,
`ADR-046-zone-routing`.

## 2. Resource shape

Every resource shares one envelope:

| Element | Ownership | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiVersion`, `kind` | derived | Qualified ResourceType, `.d2bus.org.` infix |
| `name` | operator or controller | Zone-scoped; unique per `(Zone, kind, name)` |
| `spec` | **operator-declared** | Nix mirrors this shape directly |
| `status` | **controller-owned** | Never authored by an operator |
| revision | store-owned | Monotonic; the basis for conflict detection (FR-004) |
| owner references | controller-owned | Drives dependency-safe deletion (FR-005) |
| finalizers | controller-owned | Gate deletion until cleanup completes |

Only `name`, Zone, and `apiVersion` are derived or defaulted from the Nix authoring form;
everything else in `spec` mirrors the canonical ResourceSpec one-to-one.

Owning spec: `ADR-046-resource-object-model`. Reference fields: `ADR-046-terminology-and-identities`.

---

## 3. The 19 standard ResourceTypes

Grouped by their **exclusive** owning spec. Foundation specs define shared contracts but do
not co-own a type.

| Owning spec | ResourceTypes |
| --- | --- |
| `ADR-046-resources-zone-control` | `Zone`, `ZoneLink`, `Provider`, `Role`, `RoleBinding`, `Quota`, `EmergencyPolicy`, `ResourceExport`, `ResourceImport` |
| `ADR-046-resources-host-guest-process-user` | `Host`, `Guest`, `Process`, `EphemeralProcess`, `User`, `Endpoint` |
| `ADR-046-resources-volume` | `Volume` |
| `ADR-046-resources-network` | `Network` |
| `ADR-046-resources-device` | `Device` |
| `ADR-046-resources-credential` | `Credential` |

### Types most load-bearing for User Story 1

- **`Guest`** - a workload VM. Absorbs the retired `WorkloadPlacement` into
  `spec.providerRef` plus provider-specific `spec.*` fields and `ZoneLink` routing.
- **`Process`** / **`EphemeralProcess`** - long-lived and one-shot execution. `EphemeralProcess`
  replaces the retired `DurableExecutionProvider` trait entirely; there is no separate Provider
  family for it.
- **`Volume`** - carries `stateSchema`, `persistenceClass`, and `sensitivityClass`; the anchor
  for Provider-owned durable state, incident hold, and unclaimed-volume GC.
- **`Host`** - carries the explicit no-isolation posture for unsafe-local in `status`,
  conditions, CLI warnings, and audit. This value **must not** be silently dropped and **must
  not** become a telemetry label, span attribute, or log field.

## 4. Lifecycle and state transitions

```text
declared (Nix activation)
   |
   v
recorded  --- durable commit, revision assigned
   |
   v
reconciling  --- controller drives observed toward declared
   |            (waits, with a stated reason, on unready dependencies)
   v
ready  ------------------------> degraded  (specific cause + actionable next step)
   |                                |
   | operator removes declaration   | operator repairs or removes
   v                                v
retiring --- finalizers run, reverse-dependency order, progress visible
   |
   v
gone
```

Rules acceptance tests must enforce:

- An **effect is never released before its durable commit is proven** - across restart, abort,
  and conflict (FR-006, SC-007). The commit proof is single-use and consumed.
- Removing a declared resource activates the new generation immediately and requests
  asynchronous owner- and finalizer-safe deletion with visible Degraded cleanup status.
  Dynamic controller-owned resources are **not** broadly swept (FR-005).
- On restart the runtime **re-adopts** live resources; it does not recreate or destroy them
  (FR-003). Ambiguity is quarantined and reported as degraded, never resolved by cleanup.

Owning specs: `ADR-046-resource-reconciliation`, `ADR-046-core-controllers`,
`ADR-046-provider-state`.

## 5. Access and authorization

| Entity | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Component session** | The authenticated, single-owner association through which all resource access is admitted. Admission evidence is consumed into one owner and cannot be cloned or replayed. |
| **Subject** | Resolved **only** by the Zone registrar from verified peer evidence. A caller-supplied subject claim is refused - this is the boundary that relocated six times during W1 and is now sealed in the compiler. |
| **`Role` / `RoleBinding`** | Zone-local RBAC. Every operation is authorized before it executes; every denial is audited (FR-007). |
| **`Quota` / `EmergencyPolicy`** | Zone-wide ceilings and emergency controls as first-class resources with their own controllers and status. |

Relay or transport credentials authenticate transport only. They are **never** mapped to a
local lifecycle role; `SO_PEERCRED` plus `d2b` group membership remains the sole local
authorization surface.

Owning specs: `ADR-046-resource-api-and-authorization`, `ADR-046-componentsession-and-bus`.

---

## 6. Provider model

| Element | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **`Provider` resource** | The installed, supervised unit implementing one or more ResourceTypes |
| **Dossier** | The per-Provider normative spec; 27 exist, one per installed Provider |
| **Owned state** | Provider-owned durable state lives in a `Volume` with declared persistence and sensitivity class |
| **Effect port** | The only way a Provider causes a host effect. A Provider never receives a raw host path or unmediated privilege (FR-012, D077) |

Provider families for W6 parallelism: credentials; interaction; storage/network/device;
system/host/guest; transport/observability/activation.

Owning specs: `ADR-046-provider-model-and-packaging`, `ADR-046-provider-state`,
`docs/specs/providers/ADR-046-provider-*`.

---

## 7. Delivery entities

These are program-tracking entities, not runtime resources, but acceptance criteria reference
them (FR-025 through FR-045).

| Entity | Key attributes | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Wave** | id `W0`-`W8`, member specs, parallel groups, entry and exit criteria | entered, snapshotted, panelled, sealed, merged |
| **Work item** | `workItemId`, owning `specId`, exact destination paths, validation obligations, `reuseAction` | `Planned` -> `Merged` (14 of 545 today) |
| **Candidate snapshot** | `candidate_id`, `content_id`, `snapshot_sha256`, base and head OIDs, expected pull requests | immutable; any content change invalidates it |
| **Panel receipt** | one per role, 10 roles, 14 fields, pinned provider/model/reasoning effort | `signoff` true iff `recommendations` is empty |
| **Seal** | binds candidate, content, and snapshot digests after all lanes and the panel pass | requires every wave work item `Merged` |

Delivery state lives outside the repository at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/d2b/delivery` and the tooling
refuses any root inside a git working tree, which enforces FR-027's "never committed" rule
structurally rather than by convention.

Owning spec: `ADR-046-validation-and-delivery`.

## 8. Validation rules traceable to requirements

| Rule | Requirement | Where enforced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resource name and Zone qualification regex | FR-001 | Nix eval assertions, schema |
| Stale-revision write is refused | FR-004 | store conflict detection |
| Effect requires consumed commit proof | FR-006 | controller toolkit |
| Cross-Zone ordinary reference refused | FR-009 | resource API authorization |
| Caller-supplied subject refused | FR-008 | Zone registrar, compile-time seal |
| No secret, path, or PII in telemetry or audit | FR-018 | redaction policy lints |
| Generated artifact matches source | FR-031 | `make test-drift`, fail-closed |
| Capability with promised successor reaches parity | FR-041 | per-path removal proof + parity check |
| Capability without successor is listed and justified | FR-042 | explicit retirement list + release notes |
