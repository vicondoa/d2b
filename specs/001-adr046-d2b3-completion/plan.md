# Implementation Plan: Complete the ADR-046 Provider Control Plane (d2b 3.0)

**Branch**: `001-adr046-d2b3-completion` | **Date**: 2026-07-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-adr046-d2b3-completion/spec.md`

## Summary

Turn the ADR-046 foundation delivered in waves W0 and W1 - currently 52k lines of
deliberately test-only, production-unwired code that no shipped binary depends on - into a
live Zone-scoped resource control plane, replace the pre-ADR-046 control plane through a
one-time destructive cutover, and release the result as d2b 3.0.

The design work is already done and Accepted: 55 normative specs, a 600-node implementation
graph, and 545 work items with exact destination paths and validation obligations. This plan
therefore does **not** re-derive architecture. It sequences the remaining 531 work items
across waves W2 through W8, resolves the four unknowns that block starting (next-wave scope,
the failed footprint gate, the companion release blocker, and the parity/retirement split),
and defines how each wave passes its gate.

The approach is delivery-shaped, not design-shaped: launch each wave's file-disjoint parallel
groups together, gate every wave on imported validation evidence plus one unanimous ten-role
panel bound to an immutable snapshot, merge through pull requests only after those gates pass,
and cut exactly one release at the end.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.94.1 (pinned via `packages/rust-toolchain.toml`, components
`rustfmt` and `clippy`); Nix for the NixOS module surface

**Primary Dependencies**: redb `=4.1.0` (provisional pin, quarantined in the proof workspace
until the corrected backend lands per D128); ttrpc/protobuf for the resource service; Noise
handshakes for ComponentSession; Cloud Hypervisor and crosvm as runtime backends. No new
toolchain, linter, formatter, or nixpkgs overlay is introduced.

**Storage**: One embedded redb database per Zone, opened by owned fd, with full crash-safe
durability - one fsync per write transaction, no reduced-durability mode. Write queue 256,
group-commit batch 16, read pool 4, concurrent reads 16, read lifetime 250 ms.

**Testing**: Existing closed layer set - nix-unit eval cases, Rust unit and binary integration
tests, rendered-artifact contract tests, policy lints, and flake checks at Layer 1; podman
containers and `runNixOSTest` at Layer 2; hardware, live-host, and cloud tiers manual. No new
top-level shell gate. Every heavy lane runs through the two-slot `xtask heavy-gate` semaphore.

**Target Platform**: `x86_64-linux` NixOS host with KVM, single trusted user. Graphics paths
are x86_64-only by existing platform gate.

**Project Type**: NixOS module framework plus a multi-crate Rust control plane (35 workspace
members today, plus two deliberately excluded standalone workspaces)

**Performance Goals**: Empty-store readiness <=500 ms; p95 local Get and bounded List <=2 ms;
p95 crash-safe single-resource mutation <=10 ms; p95 durable commit to controller handler
start <=5 ms; p95 ready Process commit to launch-attempt start <=20 ms

**Constraints**: Whole-process RSS <=24,576 KiB with **no baseline subtraction** - currently
MEASURED-FAIL at 25,216 KiB, resolved only by the four named design corrections; aggregate
idle RSS <=64 MiB; per-component budgets 22 MiB for `Provider/system-core` and 12 MiB for
`Provider/system-minijail`; per-Provider-crate hermetic suite aggregate process-CPU p95 <=3 s

**Scale/Scope**: 531 remaining work items across 53 specs and 7 waves; 27 Provider crates;
19 standard ResourceTypes; hard fixtures at 10,000 resources and 100 concurrent watches

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-checked after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Assessment | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **I. Daemon-Only Control Plane** | ADR-046 adds per-Zone runtimes as **parent-spawned processes**, not PID1 units, and DELETEs the three per-realm units. Unit count does not grow; the `systemctl list-units` exit criterion is unchanged. Restart remains a continuation event via FR-003. | PASS (see research R5) |
| **II. Broker-Mediated Audited Privilege** | FR-012 keeps every privileged host mutation on the audited broker path; D077 forbids any Provider process importing the broker, enforced by a policy lint. `SO_PEERCRED` plus group membership stays the sole local authz surface. | PASS |
| **III. Reasonable Isolation Over Convenience** | FR-009 default-denies cross-Zone reference; FR-014 fails closed on missing identity state rather than reinitializing; virtiofsd zero-capability and per-VM store-farm invariants are untouched. | PASS |
| **IV. Contract-Driven Compatibility** | 3.0 is a deliberate major-version clean break with v3 schemas, versioned artifacts, and fail-closed drift gates (FR-031). The absence of a compatibility layer is the *decided* migration strategy, not unversioned drift. | PASS |
| **V. Test-Layer Discipline** | FR-032 pins coverage to the lowest hermetic layer and forbids a new top-level shell gate; FR-029 routes every heavy lane through the single semaphore; FR-033 retires superseded suites. | PASS |
| **VI. Panel-Gated Multi-Phase Work** | FR-026 requires unanimous ten-role sign-off with zero recommendations per wave. Panels run as 10 read-only subagent lanes on `gpt-5.6-sol` at `xhigh`. Waves are pipelined per **constitution 2.0.0**: implementation starts at 5 of 10 predecessor panels, while panel, seal, and merge stay strictly ordered. **Two deviations from the ADR-046 delivery contract as written** remain: the W0/W1 waiver and pipelined dispatch. | PASS with tracked deviations |
| **VII. Traceable, Marker-Free Shipped Artifacts** | Wave tags stay in commits and planning artifacts; SC-018 requires the release notes carry zero process markers; FR-019 lands docs with their behavior. ASCII-hyphen rule observed throughout. | PASS |

**Gate result**: PASS. One deviation is recorded in Complexity Tracking rather than silently
absorbed.

**Execution model**: this plan is executed by a coding agent dispatching subagents. Wide
parallel fan-out is a positive obligation, not an optimization - the delivery contract fails
wave entry when a ready, file-disjoint slice is left unlaunched. One write-capable subagent per
parallel group, each in its own worktree; 10 read-only panel lanes on
`gpt-5.6-sol` at `xhigh`. Heavy validation is capped at 2 concurrent lanes by the OFD-locked
semaphore regardless of how many implementation subagents are running. See tasks.md
"Parallel subagent execution model".

**Post-design re-check (after Phase 1)**: PASS, unchanged. The design artifacts introduce no
new units, no new privileged path, no new top-level test gate, no new toolchain or overlay, and
no compatibility shim. `spec-coverage.md` strengthens Principle IV compliance by binding the
plan to the generated manifests instead of a hand-maintained restatement. Three deviations are
tracked in Complexity Tracking: the W0/W1 waiver, FR-043's program-local tracking, and the
panel-model change.

## Specification coverage and the no-detail-loss rule

The ADR-046 set is the design. This plan sequences and gates it; it does **not** restate it,
and it must not lose it.

**The manifests are authoritative.** Every work item carries 15 fields, including
`detailedDesign`, `validation`, `destination`, `integration`, `dataMigration`, `currentSource`,
`reuseAction`, `reuseSource`, `dependencyOwner`, and `removalProof`. Those fields are carried
**verbatim** into `tasks.md` and into the implementing change. They are never paraphrased,
condensed, or selectively quoted, because a paraphrase silently drops obligations that the
wave seal will later be asserted against.

**Why this plan does not inline the spec text.** Copying 545 items of design and validation
prose into planning artifacts would create a second source of truth that no drift gate checks,
which is a worse failure than referencing the authoritative bytes. Instead:

- [spec-coverage.md](./spec-coverage.md) enumerates **all 55 specs and all 545 work items**,
  accounting for each exactly once, generated from the committed manifests so it cannot drift.
- Full text for any item is one command away:
  `jq --arg id <ID> '.items[] | select(.workItemId==$id)' docs/specs/ADR-046-work-items.json`
- `spec-coverage.md` also captures the set-wide obligations that belong to no single item and
  are therefore easiest to lose: the standing Gate 0 conditions, the 129 frozen decisions, the
  exclusive ResourceType ownership map, the ten hard numeric targets, the contended-file
  prep rules, and the three-part deletion obligation.
- It closes with a detail-preservation checklist to run against `tasks.md` before
  implementation starts.

**Completeness reconciles**: 55 specs, 545 items, 14 `Merged` and 531 `Planned`, splitting
8/6/19/4/32/146/257/73 across W0-W7 with W8 recorded at W7 close. Every item carries a
non-empty `removalProof`, so FR-023's per-path proof obligation is already itemized rather
than needing to be invented.

A `tasks.md` that does not cover every `Planned` id in `spec-coverage.md` is incomplete by
definition.

**Structure Decision**: No new top-level structure is introduced. The program extends the
existing `packages/` workspace, `nixos-modules/`, `docs/reference/`, and `tests/` trees at the
exact destinations the implementation graph names. New crates follow the established
`d2b-provider-<base>-<implementation>` layout so the existing provider-crate-layout policy lint
applies without modification.

### Wave sequencing

| Wave | Specs | Items | Parallel groups | Gate note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W2 | 2 | 19 | 2, file-disjoint, zero overlap edges | Ready to launch now |
| W3 | 1 | 4 | 1, strictly serial | Every Provider dossier depends on it |
| W4 | 5 | 32 | 5 parallel | |
| W5 | 7 | 146 | 7 parallel + the store chain | Carries RK-1, the corrected engine |
| W6 | 27 | 257 | 5 file-disjoint families | Largest wave; hermetic suites are independent |
| W7 | 5 | 73 | 1 closing group | Destructive cutover |
| W8 | 0 | TBD | friction closure | Terminal; release gate evaluated here |

### Recorded drift

`ADR-046-validation-and-delivery` §3.2 lists `packages/d2b-process/` and
`packages/d2b-provider-supervisor/` under W2. No W2 work item targets either path; the owning
item `ADR046-process-001` is W4. Per "existing code is canon" the machine-readable graph wins.
This plan follows the graph. Correcting the prose is a specification amendment that re-opens
that spec's evidence, so it is raised to the integrator rather than fixed mid-wave.

`ADR-046-telemetry-audit-and-support` work item `ADR046-reuse-005` required the
`observability-otel` Provider to emit authoritative `SessionConnect` records "via `d2b-audit`".
That obligation is not dischargeable from a Provider crate and contradicts two committed,
passing surfaces. `ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_DEPS` in
`packages/d2b-contract-tests/tests/policy_provider_crates.rs` admits only `d2b-contracts`,
`d2b-controller-toolkit`, `d2b-core`, `d2b-process-conformance`, `d2b-provider` and
`d2b-provider-toolkit`, and `packages/d2b-provider-toolkit/src/audit.rs` states in code that the
Provider agent ring is "diagnostic, never the authority for what happened". The authoritative
writer already exists at `packages/d2b-session/src/audit.rs` and belongs to `ADR046-audit-003`.
Per "existing code is canon" the code wins, and per the ruling class established in
`implementation-debt.md` §16.1 this is a manifest defect rather than permission for a
slice-local workaround. The correction was authored in the member spec and regenerated:
the Provider is the subject of the record, not its author; the crate takes no `d2b-audit` and
no direct `d2b-telemetry` dependency; the closed `METRIC_LABEL_POLICY` data is single-sourced
in `d2b-contracts` and re-exported by both sides. `ADR046-telem-006`'s validation phrase was
corrected in the same pass to distinguish the table-driven four-variant test of the one shared
ingress gate, which is owed now, from live `otlp_unix` / `otlp_vsock` / `import_stream`
adapters, which that item's own Removal proof sequences after the OTLP exporter.

The W5 removal-proof inventory originally grouped eleven Rust crates together. The
implementation graph and live dependency tree permit only three removals in W5:
`d2b-daemon-access`, `d2b-host-providers` with its sole
`d2b-host::runtime_provider` consumer, and the already-retired `d2b-userd` stub. The realm
session crates are retained for the W7 Provider-session migration, `d2b-provider-aca` and
`d2b-provider-relay` are W6 Provider surfaces, `d2b-unsafe-local-helper` is reused by W7, and
`d2b-guestd` is the live guest-control service rather than a legacy stub. The work-item wave
ownership and committed runtime wiring force this boundary; deleting the later-wave surfaces
in W5 would remove their only current implementations.

ADR 0051 Amendment F describes the audio dossier's `implementationEndpointRefs` as appearing
only in YAML examples and prose. At the c62e57ce integration tip, the committed
`AudioService.spec` table already has a typed `Type` column for that field and every other
base field. Per "existing code is canon", this wave leaves the already-correct audio table
unchanged and adds only the missing typed Service tables to the security-key and USBIP
dossiers.

ADR 0051 Amendment E names two provider admission variants that are not present in the
current `d2b_core::error::Kind` catalog. This docs-only scope cannot add Rust error records,
and `gen-error-codes` owns the auto-generated table, so the two normative rows are recorded
in a separate provider projection admission table rather than hand-editing generated output.
The generated runtime catalog remains unchanged and its drift gate stays authoritative. The
corresponding `ProviderContractError` variants and the protocol-version field are also absent
from the current Rust implementation; those implementation changes belong to the downstream
ADR 0051 consumer slice.

Amendment A is likewise intentionally ahead of the current implementation: the committed
`semantic_services/security_key.rs` still models `allowed_backing_ref_types: None` and
`BackingRefTypesUndetermined`, while `ProjectionFactory::new` still rejects an empty backing
set. This docs-only slice records the accepted deny-all contract and leaves that Rust
implementation drift for the consumer slice rather than editing out-of-scope code.

ADR 0051 Amendment G is outside this W5 request, which consumes amendments A-F and H.
`ADR-046-nix-configuration.md` is therefore deliberately left unchanged.

`ADR046-zone-control-001` authorizes removing the legacy `Realm` model but does not make the
whole `d2b-realm-core` crate mechanically replaceable. In particular,
`d2b-contracts::v3::resource_status::ResourceUpdateStatus` still uses the realm-core string
`OperationId`, while the v3 ComponentSession contract owns a distinct fixed-width, redacted
`OperationId`. Choosing the v3 status wire representation is an architectural decision and is
not inferred by a removal slice. This blocks eventual realm-core retirement, not the three
W5-owned stub removals above.

The SPIKE-01 RSS rerun amendment landed against
[`amendment-spike-01-rerun.md`](./amendment-spike-01-rerun.md) and produced three drift
records worth carrying forward.

The draft prescribes pinning the policy fingerprint to the wording
`6,148 KiB below 24,576 KiB`. The committed result artifact,
`proofs/redb-resource-store-spike/RESULTS-rerun-2026-08-02.md`, does not emit that phrase; its
canonical measurement cell reads ``Median `18,428 KiB`, `6,148 KiB` below the threshold``. Per
"existing code is canon" the artifact wins, and the artifact is out of scope for this change.
The lint therefore pins the artifact's actual wording as the canonical fingerprint and pins the
draft's phrasing as the *derived* prose the specifications restate, with the `24,576 KiB` value
bound separately through the row's threshold key. Both numbers and the gate are still pinned;
only the sentence that carries them differs from the draft.

The draft's verbatim §3.2 replacement text says "remain W5 implementation work". The surrounding
table uses the `ADR046-W<n>` namespace throughout, so the applied text says `ADR046-W5`. This is
a namespace normalization, not a scope change.

`plan.md`'s **Constraints** line still reads "currently MEASURED-FAIL at 25,216 KiB". That
figure is now superseded; the corrected proof measurement is 18,428 KiB with 6,148 KiB of
headroom below the unchanged 24,576 KiB gate and no baseline subtraction. The line is left
unedited because this change's ownership is scoped to the Recorded-drift and Gate-status content
here, and because the production constraint the line states - `<=24,576 KiB` with no baseline
subtraction - is itself unchanged. The exact replacement clause a follow-up should apply is
"currently MEASURED-PASS on the disposable proof at 18,428 KiB and unmeasured on the production
engine".

Eleven W5 work items and two already-`Merged` items name destination crates that do not
exist, where a committed crate covers the same obligation under a different name. The full
adjudication is [`amendment-w5-destination-drift.md`](./amendment-w5-destination-drift.md);
the summary is that FR-046 does not decide this class, because both sides of the
disagreement are the generated manifest rather than prose against a manifest.
`ADR046-exec-016` names `packages/d2b-bus-session/` while `ADR046-session-001`, `Merged` in
W1, names `packages/d2b-session/`, and both are rows in `ADR-046-work-items.json`. "Existing
code is canon" decides it, and the committed crate is the destination:
`d2b-session`/`d2b-session-unix`, `d2b-bus`, `d2b-zone-routing`, `d2b-resource-client`,
`d2b-resource-api`, and `d2b-provider`. The session-crate pair is not drift at all - the
member spec's own text says "rename crate ... or retain name". Two obligations are genuinely
absent rather than relocated, `ProcessAttachClient` and
`nixos-modules/options-volumes.nix`, and both stay outstanding against their `Planned`
items. No item is marked complete on file presence.

The three W5 crate removals now carry real FR-023 proofs in
[`removal-proof-w5.md`](./removal-proof-w5.md), replacing the rationale paragraph above as
the evidence of record. Two migration-map rows moved to W5 under FR-060, one row was retired
as naming a path that does not exist at the map's own baseline, and the
`d2b-daemon-access` ADAPT disposition is raised as drift rather than corrected, because the
migration map is a member specification.

### Gate status

Gate 0 has been re-evaluated a second time under FR-056; the record is
[`gate0-reevaluation-spike-01-rss-rerun.md`](./gate0-reevaluation-spike-01-rss-rerun.md). The
mechanical half is discharged: four member digests moved, seven work-item strings changed, and
`ADR-046-implementation-graph.md` is byte-identical, so the specification-to-work-item bijection
is provably untouched.

The human-review half is **not** empty this time. `ADR046-W5` holds an outstanding ten-role panel
request with imported validation evidence - including a `redb-rss-spike-observation` record -
gathered before the amendment. FR-056 requires that evidence to be regathered rather than carried
forward, so W5 must re-snapshot, re-import, and re-request its panel before it may seal. No wave
has sealed under the superseded text, so no merged wave needs re-panelling.

Waves W6 through W8 are unaffected. `ADR046-store-002`, `ADR046-store-004`, `ADR046-store-005`,
and `ADR046-reconcile-003` remain `Planned` in W5: the passing rerun measures a disposable proof
crate, not `packages/d2b-resource-store-redb`, and supplies none of those items' production
evidence.

That caveat is load bearing rather than ceremonial, and it became more so once the production
backend landed. `packages/d2b-resource-store-redb/src/{actor,transaction,revision_log,backup}.rs`
were added by `0a080828` on 2026-07-31, 349 commits before this amendment's base `c3e15b66`.
The code exists; the measurement does not. The crate has **no `benches/` directory and no
resident-memory harness of any kind**, so the production whole-process RSS obligation named by
`ADR046-store-004`, `ADR046-store-002`, and `ADR046-store-005` is not merely unmet, it is
currently unmeasurable. A reviewer who sees a green spike rerun beside a landed backend and
concludes the backend's RSS gate is satisfied has made exactly the inference this amendment
exists to block. All four items therefore stay `Planned` in the manifest, and the delivery
obligation is a production measurement, not a re-reading of the proof result.

The backend commit predates the amendment base, so it is outside this focused Gate 0 review and
is not reverted or re-adjudicated here.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| W0 and W1 delivered without the panel and seal that Principle VI and the delivery contract's exit criteria require (FR-034) | Both waves are already merged. Their binding panel would have to run against an immutable snapshot that no longer exists in a single canonical form - delivery state holds ten competing W0 candidates, one panel-request, zero receipts, and zero seals, and W1 has no delivery state at all. The condition W2 close actually tests, every prior work item recorded `Merged`, is satisfied; per FR-057 that is an exit condition, not an entry one. | Retroactively panelling and sealing both waves was rejected: it would attest to a reconstructed snapshot, which is weaker evidence than an honest waiver and sets a worse precedent than admitting the gap. Renumbering so the first sealed wave becomes W0 was rejected: it invalidates the committed implementation graph, the work-item manifest, and 445 commits of `ADR046-W0` tags for no verification gain. FR-035 confines the waiver to a one-time exception, and SC-021 forces the waived foundation to become production-reachable, which re-tests it under real load. |
| FR-043 (recovery-point attestation) is tracked program-local, outside the work-item manifest, so the W7 seal does not enforce it | FR-043 is locally added and **stricter** than `ADR-046-reset-and-cutover`, which permits proceeding past the rollback boundary without attestation. Creating a manifest work item would require amending that member spec, which re-opens its validation and panel evidence and re-triggers Gate 0. | Amending the spec was considered and rejected for cost. The accepted consequence is explicit: **a green W7 seal is not evidence that FR-043 shipped.** T580 and the W7 merge review are the only enforcement. This is the highest-consequence gap in the plan, because FR-043 is the primary safety control for the accepted daily-driver validation risk - if it slips, it slips silently. |
| Waves are pipelined: implementation of wave N+1 begins at 5 of 10 wave-N panel returns plus green integration, rather than after unanimous sign-off | Panel review commonly runs one to two times the coding duration. Strict serialization idles implementation capacity for more than half of every cycle across seven remaining waves. | Not a loosening of the gate, and deliberately not implemented as one. Unanimity, roster, seal ordering, and merge ordering are all unchanged; only the dispatch point moves, and the successor must rebase onto the merged predecessor **before** its own panel so no panel ever reviews a tree built on unreviewed contracts. Required **constitution 2.0.0** (Principle VI redefined, MAJOR bump) plus a member-spec amendment and a tooling change (T585-T587); until those land the pipeline is not executable. Accepted cost is rework when a predecessor finding invalidates in-flight successor work - FR-050 forbids citing that rework as grounds to shorten a panel. |
