# Implementation Plan: Complete the ADR-046 Provider Control Plane (d2b 3.0)

**Branch**: `001-adr046-d2b3-completion` | **Date**: 2026-07-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-adr046-d2b3-completion/spec.md`

## Summary

Turn the ADR-046 foundation delivered in waves W0 and W1 - currently 52k lines of
deliberately test-only, production-unwired code that no shipped binary depends on - into a
live Zone-scoped resource control plane, replace the pre-ADR-046 control plane through a
one-time destructive cutover, and release the result as d2b 3.0.

The design work is already done and Accepted: 55 normative specs, a 600-node implementation
graph, and 545 work items with exact destination paths and validation obligations. This plan
therefore does **not** re-derive architecture. It sequences the remaining 531 work items
across waves W2 through W8, resolves the four unknowns that block starting (next-wave scope,
the failed footprint gate, the companion release blocker, and the parity/retirement split),
and defines how each wave passes its gate.

The approach is delivery-shaped, not design-shaped: launch each wave's file-disjoint parallel
groups together, gate every wave on imported validation evidence plus one unanimous ten-role
panel bound to an immutable snapshot, merge through pull requests only after those gates pass,
and cut exactly one release at the end.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.94.1 (pinned via `packages/rust-toolchain.toml`, components
`rustfmt` and `clippy`); Nix for the NixOS module surface

**Primary Dependencies**: redb `=4.1.0` (provisional pin, quarantined in the proof workspace
until the corrected backend lands per D128); ttrpc/protobuf for the resource service; Noise
handshakes for ComponentSession; Cloud Hypervisor and crosvm as runtime backends. No new
toolchain, linter, formatter, or nixpkgs overlay is introduced.

**Storage**: One embedded redb database per Zone, opened by owned fd, with full crash-safe
durability - one fsync per write transaction, no reduced-durability mode. Write queue 256,
group-commit batch 16, read pool 4, concurrent reads 16, read lifetime 250 ms.

**Testing**: Existing closed layer set - nix-unit eval cases, Rust unit and binary integration
tests, rendered-artifact contract tests, policy lints, and flake checks at Layer 1; podman
containers and `runNixOSTest` at Layer 2; hardware, live-host, and cloud tiers manual. No new
top-level shell gate. Every heavy lane runs through the two-slot `xtask heavy-gate` semaphore.

**Target Platform**: `x86_64-linux` NixOS host with KVM, single trusted user. Graphics paths
are x86_64-only by existing platform gate.

**Project Type**: NixOS module framework plus a multi-crate Rust control plane (35 workspace
members today, plus two deliberately excluded standalone workspaces)

**Performance Goals**: Empty-store readiness <=500 ms; p95 local Get and bounded List <=2 ms;
p95 crash-safe single-resource mutation <=10 ms; p95 durable commit to controller handler
start <=5 ms; p95 ready Process commit to launch-attempt start <=20 ms

**Constraints**: Whole-process RSS <=24,576 KiB with **no baseline subtraction** - currently
MEASURED-FAIL at 25,216 KiB, resolved only by the four named design corrections; aggregate
idle RSS <=64 MiB; per-component budgets 22 MiB for `Provider/system-core` and 12 MiB for
`Provider/system-minijail`; per-Provider-crate hermetic suite aggregate process-CPU p95 <=3 s

**Scale/Scope**: 531 remaining work items across 53 specs and 7 waves; 27 Provider crates;
19 standard ResourceTypes; hard fixtures at 10,000 resources and 100 concurrent watches

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-checked after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Assessment | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **I. Daemon-Only Control Plane** | ADR-046 adds per-Zone runtimes as **parent-spawned processes**, not PID1 units, and DELETEs the three per-realm units. Unit count does not grow; the `systemctl list-units` exit criterion is unchanged. Restart remains a continuation event via FR-003. | PASS (see research R5) |
| **II. Broker-Mediated Audited Privilege** | FR-012 keeps every privileged host mutation on the audited broker path; D077 forbids any Provider process importing the broker, enforced by a policy lint. `SO_PEERCRED` plus group membership stays the sole local authz surface. | PASS |
| **III. Reasonable Isolation Over Convenience** | FR-009 default-denies cross-Zone reference; FR-014 fails closed on missing identity state rather than reinitializing; virtiofsd zero-capability and per-VM store-farm invariants are untouched. | PASS |
| **IV. Contract-Driven Compatibility** | 3.0 is a deliberate major-version clean break with v3 schemas, versioned artifacts, and fail-closed drift gates (FR-031). The absence of a compatibility layer is the *decided* migration strategy, not unversioned drift. | PASS |
| **V. Test-Layer Discipline** | FR-032 pins coverage to the lowest hermetic layer and forbids a new top-level shell gate; FR-029 routes every heavy lane through the single semaphore; FR-033 retires superseded suites. | PASS |
| **VI. Panel-Gated Multi-Phase Work** | FR-026 requires unanimous ten-role sign-off with zero recommendations per wave. Panels run as 10 read-only subagent lanes on `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Waves are pipelined per **constitution 2.0.0**: implementation starts at 5 of 10 predecessor panels, while panel, seal, and merge stay strictly ordered. **Three deviations from the ADR-046 delivery contract as written**: the W0/W1 waiver, the panel model, and pipelined dispatch. | PASS with tracked deviations |
| **VII. Traceable, Marker-Free Shipped Artifacts** | Wave tags stay in commits and planning artifacts; SC-018 requires the release notes carry zero process markers; FR-019 lands docs with their behavior. ASCII-hyphen rule observed throughout. | PASS |

**Gate result**: PASS. One deviation is recorded in Complexity Tracking rather than silently
absorbed.

**Execution model**: this plan is executed by a coding agent dispatching subagents. Wide
parallel fan-out is a positive obligation, not an optimization - the delivery contract fails
wave entry when a ready, file-disjoint slice is left unlaunched. One write-capable subagent per
parallel group, each in its own worktree; 10 read-only panel lanes on
`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Heavy validation is capped at 2 concurrent lanes by the OFD-locked
semaphore regardless of how many implementation subagents are running. See tasks.md
"Parallel subagent execution model".

**Post-design re-check (after Phase 1)**: PASS, unchanged. The design artifacts introduce no
new units, no new privileged path, no new top-level test gate, no new toolchain or overlay, and
no compatibility shim. `spec-coverage.md` strengthens Principle IV compliance by binding the
plan to the generated manifests instead of a hand-maintained restatement. Three deviations are
tracked in Complexity Tracking: the W0/W1 waiver, FR-043's program-local tracking, and the
panel-model change.

## Specification coverage and the no-detail-loss rule

The ADR-046 set is the design. This plan sequences and gates it; it does **not** restate it,
and it must not lose it.

**The manifests are authoritative.** Every work item carries 15 fields, including
`detailedDesign`, `validation`, `destination`, `integration`, `dataMigration`, `currentSource`,
`reuseAction`, `reuseSource`, `dependencyOwner`, and `removalProof`. Those fields are carried
**verbatim** into `tasks.md` and into the implementing change. They are never paraphrased,
condensed, or selectively quoted, because a paraphrase silently drops obligations that the
wave seal will later be asserted against.

**Why this plan does not inline the spec text.** Copying 545 items of design and validation
prose into planning artifacts would create a second source of truth that no drift gate checks,
which is a worse failure than referencing the authoritative bytes. Instead:

- [spec-coverage.md](./spec-coverage.md) enumerates **all 55 specs and all 545 work items**,
  accounting for each exactly once, generated from the committed manifests so it cannot drift.
- Full text for any item is one command away:
  `jq --arg id <ID> '.items[] | select(.workItemId==$id)' docs/specs/ADR-046-work-items.json`
- `spec-coverage.md` also captures the set-wide obligations that belong to no single item and
  are therefore easiest to lose: the standing Gate 0 conditions, the 129 frozen decisions, the
  exclusive ResourceType ownership map, the ten hard numeric targets, the contended-file
  prep rules, and the three-part deletion obligation.
- It closes with a detail-preservation checklist to run against `tasks.md` before
  implementation starts.

**Completeness reconciles**: 55 specs, 545 items, 14 `Merged` and 531 `Planned`, splitting
8/6/19/4/32/146/257/73 across W0-W7 with W8 recorded at W7 close. Every item carries a
non-empty `removalProof`, so FR-023's per-path proof obligation is already itemized rather
than needing to be invented.

A `tasks.md` that does not cover every `Planned` id in `spec-coverage.md` is incomplete by
definition.

```

**Structure Decision**: No new top-level structure is introduced. The program extends the
existing `packages/` workspace, `nixos-modules/`, `docs/reference/`, and `tests/` trees at the
exact destinations the implementation graph names. New crates follow the established
`d2b-provider-<base>-<implementation>` layout so the existing provider-crate-layout policy lint
applies without modification.

### Wave sequencing

| Wave | Specs | Items | Parallel groups | Gate note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W2 | 2 | 19 | 2, file-disjoint, zero overlap edges | Ready to launch now |
| W3 | 1 | 4 | 1, strictly serial | Every Provider dossier depends on it |
| W4 | 5 | 32 | 5 parallel | |
| W5 | 7 | 146 | 7 parallel + the store chain | Carries RK-1, the corrected engine |
| W6 | 27 | 257 | 5 file-disjoint families | Largest wave; hermetic suites are independent |
| W7 | 5 | 73 | 1 closing group | Destructive cutover |
| W8 | 0 | TBD | friction closure | Terminal; release gate evaluated here |

### Recorded drift

`ADR-046-validation-and-delivery` §3.2 lists `packages/d2b-process/` and
`packages/d2b-provider-supervisor/` under W2. No W2 work item targets either path; the owning
item `ADR046-process-001` is W4. Per "existing code is canon" the machine-readable graph wins.
This plan follows the graph. Correcting the prose is a specification amendment that re-opens
that spec's evidence, so it is raised to the integrator rather than fixed mid-wave.

`ADR-046-telemetry-audit-and-support` work item `ADR046-reuse-005` required the
`observability-otel` Provider to emit authoritative `SessionConnect` records "via `d2b-audit`".
That obligation is not dischargeable from a Provider crate and contradicts two committed,
passing surfaces. `ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_DEPS` in
`packages/d2b-contract-tests/tests/policy_provider_crates.rs` admits only `d2b-contracts`,
`d2b-controller-toolkit`, `d2b-core`, `d2b-process-conformance`, `d2b-provider` and
`d2b-provider-toolkit`, and `packages/d2b-provider-toolkit/src/audit.rs` states in code that the
Provider agent ring is "diagnostic, never the authority for what happened". The authoritative
writer already exists at `packages/d2b-session/src/audit.rs` and belongs to `ADR046-audit-003`.
Per "existing code is canon" the code wins, and per the ruling class established in
`implementation-debt.md` §16.1 this is a manifest defect rather than permission for a
slice-local workaround. The correction was authored in the member spec and regenerated:
the Provider is the subject of the record, not its author; the crate takes no `d2b-audit` and
no direct `d2b-telemetry` dependency; the closed `METRIC_LABEL_POLICY` data is single-sourced
in `d2b-contracts` and re-exported by both sides. `ADR046-telem-006`'s validation phrase was
corrected in the same pass to distinguish the table-driven four-variant test of the one shared
ingress gate, which is owed now, from live `otlp_unix` / `otlp_vsock` / `import_stream`
adapters, which that item's own Removal proof sequences after the OTLP exporter.

The W5 removal-proof inventory originally grouped eleven Rust crates together. The
implementation graph and live dependency tree permit only three removals in W5:
`d2b-daemon-access`, `d2b-host-providers` with its sole
`d2b-host::runtime_provider` consumer, and the already-retired `d2b-userd` stub. The realm
session crates are retained for the W7 Provider-session migration, `d2b-provider-aca` and
`d2b-provider-relay` are W6 Provider surfaces, `d2b-unsafe-local-helper` is reused by W7, and
`d2b-guestd` is the live guest-control service rather than a legacy stub. The work-item wave
ownership and committed runtime wiring force this boundary; deleting the later-wave surfaces
in W5 would remove their only current implementations.

`ADR046-zone-control-001` authorizes removing the legacy `Realm` model but does not make the
whole `d2b-realm-core` crate mechanically replaceable. In particular,
`d2b-contracts::v3::resource_status::ResourceUpdateStatus` still uses the realm-core string
`OperationId`, while the v3 ComponentSession contract owns a distinct fixed-width, redacted
`OperationId`. Choosing the v3 status wire representation is an architectural decision and is
not inferred by a removal slice. This blocks eventual realm-core retirement, not the three
W5-owned stub removals above.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| W0 and W1 delivered without the panel and seal that Principle VI and the delivery contract's exit criteria require (FR-034) | Both waves are already merged. Their binding panel would have to run against an immutable snapshot that no longer exists in a single canonical form - delivery state holds ten competing W0 candidates, one panel-request, zero receipts, and zero seals, and W1 has no delivery state at all. The condition W2 close actually tests, every prior work item recorded `Merged`, is satisfied; per FR-057 that is an exit condition, not an entry one. | Retroactively panelling and sealing both waves was rejected: it would attest to a reconstructed snapshot, which is weaker evidence than an honest waiver and sets a worse precedent than admitting the gap. Renumbering so the first sealed wave becomes W0 was rejected: it invalidates the committed implementation graph, the work-item manifest, and 445 commits of `ADR046-W0` tags for no verification gain. FR-035 confines the waiver to a one-time exception, and SC-021 forces the waived foundation to become production-reachable, which re-tests it under real load. |
| FR-043 (recovery-point attestation) is tracked program-local, outside the work-item manifest, so the W7 seal does not enforce it | FR-043 is locally added and **stricter** than `ADR-046-reset-and-cutover`, which permits proceeding past the rollback boundary without attestation. Creating a manifest work item would require amending that member spec, which re-opens its validation and panel evidence and re-triggers Gate 0. | Amending the spec was considered and rejected for cost. The accepted consequence is explicit: **a green W7 seal is not evidence that FR-043 shipped.** T580 and the W7 merge review are the only enforcement. This is the highest-consequence gap in the plan, because FR-043 is the primary safety control for the accepted daily-driver validation risk - if it slips, it slips silently. |
| Panel reviews run on `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` rather than the model pinned by the delivery contract and by `packages/xtask/src/delivery/model.rs` | Operator direction. Copilot-native Task lanes dispatch the reviewers, and the d2b panel skill carries the binding table. | The panel model is enforced by the spec's §12.3 record shape, `PANEL_MODEL_POLICY`, the `panel-attest` rejection at `panel.rs:674`, the unit-test assertion of the exact strings, and `.github/skills/d2b-panel-round/SKILL.md`. Every panel seat is read-only and dispatches with provider `github-copilot`, model `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, reasoning effort `high`, and context tier `default`; the coding lanes use `gpt-5.6-luna` at `max` and `long_context`. |
| Waves are pipelined: implementation of wave N+1 begins at 5 of 10 wave-N panel returns plus green integration, rather than after unanimous sign-off | Panel review commonly runs one to two times the coding duration. Strict serialization idles implementation capacity for more than half of every cycle across seven remaining waves. | Not a loosening of the gate, and deliberately not implemented as one. Unanimity, roster, seal ordering, and merge ordering are all unchanged; only the dispatch point moves, and the successor must rebase onto the merged predecessor **before** its own panel so no panel ever reviews a tree built on unreviewed contracts. Required **constitution 2.0.0** (Principle VI redefined, MAJOR bump) plus a member-spec amendment and a tooling change (T585-T587); until those land the pipeline is not executable. Accepted cost is rework when a predecessor finding invalidates in-flight successor work - FR-050 forbids citing that rework as grounds to shorten a panel. |
