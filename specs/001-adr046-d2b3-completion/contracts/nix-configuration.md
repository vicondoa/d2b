# Contract: Nix configuration surface

**Owning specs**: `ADR-046-nix-configuration`, `ADR-046-zone-routing` | **Waves**: W2, W5

## What this surface is

How an operator declares intent. Nix mirrors the canonical ResourceSpec `spec` shape directly;
only name, Zone, and `apiVersion` are derived or defaulted, and `status` is controller-owned
and never authored.

## Current state

`nixos-modules/options-zones.nix` and `nixos-modules/resources.nix` exist and are imported
from `index.nix`, providing eval-time option schema for the 19 ResourceTypes and the qualified
type regex. Nothing consumes the evaluated result yet - no bundle or manifest emitter reads it.

## Obligations

| # | Obligation | Requirement | Wave |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NIX-1 | Restructure `options-zones.nix` as the generated base; emit `generated/resource-types.nix` and per-type `generated/options-zones-<Type>.nix` via `xtask gen-zone-nix-options` | FR-001 | W2 |
| NIX-2 | Emit per-Zone resource generations with integrity pinning through `zone-resources-json.nix` and a new `bundle-artifacts.nix` row | FR-001 | W2 |
| NIX-3 | Add Zone assertions to `assertions.nix` (sole W2 writer of that file) | FR-001 | W2 |
| NIX-4 | Removing a declared resource activates the new generation immediately and requests async owner- and finalizer-safe deletion with visible cleanup status | FR-005 | W5 |
| NIX-5 | Extend the `eval-*` flake checks with Zone and resource examples | FR-032 | W5 |

## Invariants

- New assertions need a matching nix-unit case; loosening an assertion silently converts a
  rejected misconfiguration into runtime breakage.
- Generated Nix is generated. Hand-editing a `generated/` file is a drift-gate failure.
- No new `nixpkgs.overlays` entry and no `nixpkgs.url` change.

## Acceptance

- A declared Zone with resources evaluates, emits its pinned generation, and is rejected at
  eval time when malformed.
- `make test-drift` is clean after regeneration.
