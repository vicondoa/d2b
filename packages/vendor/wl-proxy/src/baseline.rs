/// The baseline protocol support.
///
/// This type determines the upper bound for the globals and global versions advertised
/// by a [`State`](crate::state::State). Baselines allow new protocols and new protocol
/// versions to be added to this crate without changing the behavior of applications using
/// the crate.
///
/// For example, if an application turns xdg_toplevel objects into zwlr_layer_surface_v1
/// objects, then the application should filter out globals such as xdg_toplevel_icon_v1
/// that take xdg_toplevels as arguments. Or else it has to also intercept the messages
/// to that global. Without baselines, if a new protocol were added to a new release of
/// this crate, and if that protocol interacted with xdg_toplevels, then updating this
/// crate could cause protocol errors.
///
/// To see the contents of a baseline, look at the source file defining the baseline.
///
/// The difference between two baselines can be seen by diffing the two files containing
/// the baselines.
